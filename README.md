1.Introduction
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application built with React that helps you understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. This project was created to provide an interactive and educational tool for learning about different sorting algorithms and their behaviors.

2.Features
Visualize popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
Customize array size and speed to see how algorithms perform under different conditions.
Learn about the time complexity and visual representation of each algorithm.
Step through the sorting process or watch the algorithm in action.
